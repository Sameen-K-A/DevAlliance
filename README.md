## Development Timeline

### Day 01 - Initial Setup and Coding Screen

**Current Progress**:  

- **Coding Screen Complete**: The coding screen has been successfully implemented, enabling users to write code, execute it, and see the results in real-time. This feature enhances the core functionality of DevAlliance by providing a seamless coding and debugging experience for users.
- **Piston API Integration**: Integrated the Piston API for executing code snippets in various programming languages, allowing for immediate feedback on code execution.
- **Monaco Editor Implementation**: Incorporated Monaco Editor for an enhanced coding experience, offering features like syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and error detection.

### Day 02 - Backend and Real-Time Communication

**New Progress**:

- **Backend Setup with Express Server**: Set up an Express.js server to manage backend functionality, including room creation, joining, and managing user sessions.
- **Socket.io Integration**: Implemented Socket.io for real-time communication, allowing seamless connections and instant updates among users in the same room. This enables live code updates, real-time chat, and collaborative interactions.
- **Room Management**: Developed room creation and joining functionalities to organize collaborative sessions easily, allowing users to invite up to 5 members to each room.
- **Chat Feature with Emoji Support**: Created an in-room chat feature to facilitate smooth communication among participants. Integrated `emoji-picker-react` for emoji selection, enhancing expressiveness in messages.
- **Real-Time Code Updates with Output and Error Management**: Completed the functionality to synchronize code, output, and error handling in real-time for all members within a room. Each user sees immediate updates to the code and the corresponding output or error messages, ensuring that the entire team is on the same page during development.

### Day 03 - User Management and Clean-Up Features

**New Progress**:

- **User Listing in Rooms**: Implemented a feature to display a list of users currently in the room, similar to Google Meet. This allows participants to see who is active in the session and enhances collaboration.
- **Leave Modal**: Developed a modal prompt that appears when a user attempts to leave the room, confirming the action and ensuring that users donâ€™t accidentally exit the session.
- **Members Listing**: Created a dedicated section to list all members in the room, providing information such as their usernames and status, enhancing the collaborative experience.
- **Access User System Mic**: Integrated functionality to allow users to access and manage their system microphone settings, promoting effective audio communication during sessions.
- **Code Clean-Up Functionality**: Implemented a feature for code clean-up, allowing users to format and organize their code within the editor for better readability and maintenance.
